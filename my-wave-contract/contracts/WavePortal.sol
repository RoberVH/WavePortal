*           (https://buildspace.so/)
*           August 2021
*           It stores and retrieves waved + string messages coming from metamask wallets through web portal WavedPortal
*           also designed at the course
*           My WavePortal rendition is on replit.io ( https://waveportal-baseline-student.robervh.repl.co/ )
